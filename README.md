# Analysis-of-conventional-refinement-method-for-knowledge-graph
## About this project
In this project, we aim to identify issues with conventional knowledge graph refinement techniques. To achieve this, we evaluate these techniques using real datasets and analyze the results of the refinement process.

## Getting Started
Those modules are used in this project. So you have to install those moduels before you use this project.

+ CUDA: 12.1
+ Python: 3.10
+ Pytorch: 2.1.2
